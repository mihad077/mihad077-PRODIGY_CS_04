Simple Keylogger
This project is a basic keylogger developed using Python and the pynput library. It captures and logs keystrokes, writing them to a file for analysis or review. Please note that ethical considerations are paramount, and this tool should only be used for educational purposes with explicit permission from the user or owner of the system being monitored.

pynput library (install via pip install pynput)

Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mihad077/mihad077-PRODIGY_CS_04

Navigate to the project directory: cd simple-keylogger

Run the keylogger: python keylogger.py

The key logs will be saved in a file named key_log.txt in the same directory.

Ethical Considerations
This keylogger should only be used in compliance with applicable laws and with the explicit consent of the user whose keystrokes are being logged. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.
